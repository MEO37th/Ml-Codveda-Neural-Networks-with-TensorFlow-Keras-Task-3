# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a customer churn prediction system using machine learning with TensorFlow/Keras. The system will analyze customer data to predict which customers are likely to churn (stop using the service), enabling proactive retention strategies. The solution will process the provided churn dataset, build and train a neural network model, and provide predictions with performance metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to load and preprocess customer churn data, so that I can prepare it for machine learning model training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads the churn dataset THEN it SHALL successfully read the CSV file and display basic dataset information
2. WHEN preprocessing the data THEN the system SHALL handle missing values appropriately
3. WHEN preprocessing the data THEN the system SHALL encode categorical variables for neural network compatibility
4. WHEN preprocessing the data THEN the system SHALL normalize/scale numerical features
5. WHEN preprocessing the data THEN the system SHALL split the data into training and testing sets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to build and configure a neural network model, so that I can train it to predict customer churn accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the model THEN the system SHALL create a neural network with appropriate architecture for binary classification
2. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL use suitable activation functions for hidden and output layers
3. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
4. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL include metrics for model evaluation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train the neural network model, so that it can learn patterns in customer behavior that indicate churn risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL fit the model on the training data
2. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL use validation data to monitor training progress
3. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
4. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL save the trained model for future use
5. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL display training history and metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to evaluate model performance, so that I can assess the accuracy and reliability of churn predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL generate predictions on the test dataset
2. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL display a confusion matrix
4. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL generate a classification report
5. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to make predictions on new customer data, so that I can identify customers at risk of churning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL load the trained model
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL preprocess new data using the same transformations as training data
3. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL return churn probability scores
4. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL provide binary churn predictions (churn/no churn)
5. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be modular and maintainable, so that it can be easily extended and modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL use object-oriented design principles
2. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL separate data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation into distinct modules
3. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL include proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL include configuration parameters that can be easily adjusted
5. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL include documentation and comments for code maintainability
